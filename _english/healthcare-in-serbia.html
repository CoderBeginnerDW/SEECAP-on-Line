            <h2>Quick overview of the Serbian healthcare system</h2>
            <p class="blog_tekstovi">The Serbian Healthcare System is based on  the Bismarck Model with certain modifications. Yugoslavia was a middle-income  country which offered to its citizens a solid healthcare protection based on  the principles of universality and solidarity of healthcare for all. The same  principles are still in the foundations of the Serbian public healthcare system.  However, because of the civil war and the Sanctions during the 1990&rsquo;s the public  healthcare system is less able to deliver the desired level of universal healthcare  for all. Nowadays the <b>public healthcare  system</b> is supplemented with ever growing <b>private healthcare system</b>. <br>
              In 2017 all healthcare expenses amounted to  8,8% of Serbia&rsquo;s GDP. 57,5% of the expenses was finances out of the public  sources while 42,5% out of the private sources. The largest participation of  the healthcare cost of 10,09% in the GDP was in 2010. Comparative data of 2010  and the previous three financial years is provided in the table below. <br>
            </p>
            <img src="_images-english/Share of healthcare finance.png" alt="Share of healtcare costs">
            <p>The healthcare costs in absolute terms in  the last 3 years is shown in the table below. <br>
              <img src="_images-english/Healtcare expences in RSD and Euro.png" alt="Healtcare expenses in RSD and Euro"></p>
            <p class="blog_tekstovi">Publicly funded is all healthcare spending  funded by public sources such as the Republic Healthcare Insurance Fund, local  community transfers to locally financed healthcare institutions or Government  payments for some insured categories of population such as unemployed receiving  unemployment benefits, refugees etc. <br>
              Privately funded sources include out of  pocket payments for private healthcare, voluntary insurance schemes, out of  pocket participation in the Public healthcare sector, out of pocket payments  for drugs and medical devices. In essence, <b>42,35%</b> of the total healthcare is financed directly out of pocket, which is one of the  highest such funding in CEE.</p>

            <h2>The public healthcare system (&ldquo;SHS&rdquo;)</h2>
            <p class="blog_tekstovi">The Public healthcare system was built  prior to 1990&rsquo;s. Post 2000, the successive governments have focused on recovering  the public healthcare system from the disastrous 1990&rsquo;s. Investments have been  made into new equipment and improvement of the working conditions for doctors,  nurses and other employees as well as for the patients. Also, some new  facilities have been built such as the Clinical Centre in Nis or the existing  ones have been reconstructed and/or refurbished, some a loan from the European  Investment Bank.</p>

            <p>In 2017 the Public healthcare employed a  total of 101.853 people. About 25% or 24.979 were with university education, 9.785  with higher education and 45.399 were with secondary education, out of which  31.341 were nurses. The total number of hospital beds in 2017 was 41.654 or 5.9  beds per 1,000 population.<br>
              Health care at the primary level is  provided by primary health centres, which cover the territory of one or more  municipalities or towns. A primary health centre provides preventive health  care for all categories of population, emergency care (ER), general medicine,  health care of women and children, visiting nurses service, as well as  laboratory and other diagnostics. Primary health centres also provide  prevention and treatment in dentalcare, occupational medicine and physical  medicine and rehabilitation.<br>
              Primary health care in the primary health  centres is provided by a chosen doctor, a personal doctor selected by the  patient who is either a general practitioner (GP) or a specialist in general medicine,  or specialist in occupational medicine, paediatrics, gynaecology or dentist, as  needed. </p>
            <p class="blog_tekstovi">Apart from primary health centres, the  primary level activities include institutes, which are health institutions  providing primary health services and health care to specific population  groups, such as: institute for student health, institutes for emergency medical  care, gerontology, dentistry, pulmonary diseases and TB, and institutes for  skin and venereal diseases, as well as pharmacies which carry out  pharmaceutical health care activity. <br>
              When a patient requires a more specialised treatments,  he/she is referred to secondary and tertiary level of healthcare-general or  special hospitals, clinics or other institutions. </p>

            <h2>The private healthcare sector (&ldquo;PHS&rdquo;)</h2>
            <p class="blog_tekstovi">The Private healthcare sector originates from  the chaotic 1990&rsquo;s when, because of the UN Sanctions, the public finance almost  collapsed, and the public hospitals and clinics functioned in dire conditions.  In such conditions, flexible and more versatile private sector healthcare  surgeries and laboratories commenced offering services for out of pocket  payments for their services.</p>
            <p class="blog_tekstovi">The growth continued in the new millennium  to sizable proportion. According to the Institute for Public Health Batut, the  private healthcare system in 2017 operated 55 hospitals, 1927 non-hospital,  mainly primary healthcare institutions (excluding dental practises and  pharmacies), 136 laboratories and diagnostic centres and 4 disease prevention  centres. Out of 55 hospitals, there are 9 general hospitals, 4 psychiatric  hospitals, 34 various special hospitals and 7 hospitals for rehabilitation. <br>
              Out of 1927 non-hospital institutions, 137  are multidisciplinary institutions offering a range of services, 79 practise  general medicine which the largest number of 588 specialise in certain medical  fields such as ophthalmology, orthopedy, pulmology, cardio-vascular diseases, podiatry  etc. <br>
              In 2017 the private healthcare sector  employed a total of 7.239 people. There were 2.296 doctors, 2.950 nurses and  medical technicians and 1.431 non-medical stuff. PHS also engages on part time  basis consultants that work for the SHS. It is estimated the number of so  engaged consultants exceeds the number of permanently employed doctors by 75 %,  or about 6.500 consultants or on average about 5 consultants per institution. <br>
              The number of hospital beds in PHS in 2017 was  921. </p>

          <h2>Healthcare financing </h2>
          <header>
            <p><span class="blog_tekstovi"><span class="blog_tekstovi">The SHS is financed primarily through the  Republic Health Insurance Fund while the PHS is finance mainly with out of  pocket payments with a growing role of finance from the voluntary insurance  schemes set up by insurance companies</span>. </span></p>

          <section>
            <h3>Public healthcare system financing </h3>
            <p class="blog_tekstovi">The Public healthcare system uses an  insurance system for collection of finances which are paid into a single &ldquo;sickness  funds&rdquo; which subsequently uses so collected financial resources for the  healthcare of the insured beneficiaries. The insurance &ldquo;sickness fund&rdquo; in  Serbia is set up by law and it is called the Republic Health Insurance Fund (the  &ldquo;Fund&rdquo; or &ldquo;RHIF&rdquo;). The Fund is financed jointly by employers and employees  through payroll deduction called health insurance contribution. <br>
              The health insurance contribution is  payable by the employed, self-employed and by farmers with registered farms. In  addition, there is a possibility for voluntary payment of the national health  insurance by other categories of population, for example, a Serbian citizen  living abroad may pay health insurance for himself and/or his family in Serbia.  The national insurance contribution payable by both, the employee and the  employer at the rate of 5.15% each (or 10.30% in total) calculated on the gross  salary of the employee.<br>
              The Bismarck Model is modified since  certain categories of population who do not pay the health insurance  contribution such as unemployed or refugees, but they enjoy the healthcare  cover payable by the Government out of the collected taxes. <br>
              <img src="_images-english/Professional profile of the insured population.png" alt="Professional profile of the insured population in Serbia"></p>
            <p class="blog_tekstovi"><img src="_images-english/Age structure of all insured.png" alt="Age structure of all insured in Serbia"> <img src="_images-english/Age structure of insured in employment.png" alt="Age structure of the insured in employment"> <img src="_images-english/Age structure of insured self employed.png" alt="Age structure of insured self employed">RHIF provides healthcare cover for 6,9  million beneficiaries out of the entire population of about 7,040 million  people. <br>
              RHIF&rsquo;s annual budget is huge, which can be  seen from their consolidated P&amp;L accounts in the previous 3 financial years,  as shown in table below. <br>
              <img src="_images-english/RHIF Consolidated P&L 2.jpg" alt="RHIF Consolidated P&amp;L"></p>
            <p class="blog_tekstovi"> RHIF does not pay for patient treatment in  private healthcare institutions except in limited circumstances when the public  healthcare system is not able to provide the required service within 30 days.  Such payments are limited to diagnostics and laboratory analysis, colonoscopy, gastroscopy,  x-rays and similar minor treatments. RHIF would not pay for any treatment for treatments  for which there is established waiting list such as surgical operations, heart  bypass, cataract, hip replacement or similar, more expensive treatments.  Procedurally, the patient would have to obtain confirmation from the public  institution that he cannot be treated within the time limit of 30 following  which he can have the same treatment in the private healthcare institution, pay  for it out of the pocket and apply for the refund. There were 1.060 such  refunds in 2017&nbsp;(Davidov-Kesarsreda, 12/09/2018). Many people  consider the procedure too bureaucratic and cumbersome and do not bother to  claim the refund. &nbsp;</p>

          <h2>Private healthcare system financing </h2>
          <header>
            <p class="blog_tekstovi">Unlike the SHS, the PHS is mainly financed  with the out of pocket payments of the consumers of their services. There is  growing segment of voluntary healthcare insurance policies offered by life  insurance companies. The RHIF&rsquo;s Refund scheme is negligible. </p>
          </header>
          <section>
            <h2>Private healthcare insurance </h2>
            <p class="blog_tekstovi">In addition to the national health  insurance, there is private or voluntary health insurance which is offered by  various insurance companies such as Uniqa, Triglav, Generali, Wiener  Stadtische, Dunav Insurance. The level of protection varies depending on the scheme  or insurance packet purchased by an individual or by corporations for their  employees. The purchased packet allows the beneficiary to receive medical care  in both the publicly-owned healthcare facilities or in private hospitals and  clinics and it is linked to the insurance packet purchased.<br>
              In 2017 the total amount of private health  insurance premiums was &euro;24.4 million (US$ 29.1 million). The share of health  insurance in all insurance premiums, life and non-life, went up from 2.5% in  2016 to 3.1% in 2017. More importantly, nominally, the health insurance  premiums grew by 28.3% y-o-y compared with 2016. In H1 2018 the total amount of  private health insurance premiums was &euro;18.56 million (US$21.65 million) or 4.2%  of all insurance premiums collected. Nominally, the health insurance premiums  grew by 21.9% y-o-y compared with H1 2017.<br>
              The main obstacles for further growth of  the voluntary health insurance is the general wealth of the nation and the  absence of any tax or public health contribution payment relief to those who  pay voluntary health insurance. However, despite these obstacles, we note that  the amount of collected premiums grow much faster than the GDP and it is likely  to continue unabated. The most frequent users of the voluntary health insurance  is the middle class living in larger cities in Serbia. For a monthly premium of  &euro;15-&euro;60 they can receive a solid healthcare in either private or publicly-owned  institutions. </p>

            <h2>Private healthcare system in consolidation and growth mode </h2>
            <p class="blog_tekstovi">As it can be seen from the above data, the  private health system is very fragmented and dispersed. It is ripe for  consolidation that will create larger and financial more capable institutions  that will be able to offer more and higher quality services that includes  medical services and procedure that is up to now reserved for top hospitals in  the public sector. Such consolidating has already started. <br>
              The three dominant healthcare providers  that have established in the market are Bel Medic, Medigorup and Euromedic. In  2017 Bel Medic, Medigroup and Euromedik had combined earnings of &euro;48.360.150,  on average up by 27,20 % in comparison with their combined earnings of  &euro;38.020.385 in 2016. Most importantly, their individual earning figures show  healthy growth, as shown in the table below. <br>
              <b><img src="_images-english/Income top 3 private healthcare suppliers 2.jpg" alt="Income top 3 healthcare supplies in Serbia">Bel  Medic-</b>is one of the oldest private healthcare  supplier. It was set up in 1995 and today it has one general hospital, one  policlinic, two primary health centres and a catering business. It operates  from 5 locations, employs 353 people and engages a number of outside  consultants. It grew organically. It has contracts with a number of local and  international voluntary health insurance companies such as BUPA, Allianz, AXA,  MetLife etc. Its consolidated income in 2017 was &euro;12,34 million. They are  looking for further growth and expansion. <br>
              <b>Medigroup-</b>grew through mergers and acquisitions. It was started by a  Luxembourg registered private equity fund Blue Sea Capital in 2013. It acquired  and consolidated under the brand a number of complementary practices. Now it  has 14 different medical institutions which employ over 800 people and also  engages about 800 consultants in different field of medicine. It is well equipped  with some state-of-the-art medical equipment. In March 2018 the London based private  equity fund Mid Europa Partners acquired majority 55% stake in Medigroup. It  2017 Medigroup&rsquo;s income was &euro;23, 52 million. <br>
              <b>Euromedik-</b>started in 2002. It operates from 6 locations in Belgrade offering a  range of services. It directly employs about 200 doctors and other medical  experts and engages at least the same number of outside consultants. It boasts  a state-of-the-art medical equipment in which it has invested heavily over the  last few years. It earned &euro;12,49 million, very similar to Bel Medic, but its  growth rate almost doubled the growth rate of Bel Medic (29,39% and 16,48%  respectively). <br>
              Belgrade healthcare market is fairly  covered now. The market players will have to search for market expansion in the  Serbian countryside, in second cities such as Novi Sad, Nis or Kragujevac, to  come closer to the client base. Setting up new surgeries or policlinics is one  of the possible solutions, acquisition of or merger with the existing local  healthcare providers is the other one. So far, the meteoric rise of Medigroup  shows that the growth through mergers and acquisition proved to be more  efficient from the organic one. Medigroup has already moved in that direction  by setting new medical facilities in the Serbian second largest city Novi Sad  and in Podgorica, the capital of Montenegro. </p>

            <h3><b>Where the further income  growth is going to come from? </b></h3>
            <p class="blog_tekstovi"><b>Local  population-</b>rising personal income<b>, </b>voluntary healthcare insurance and  the desire to have reasonably good healthcare in a comfortable environment  which one can book in 24 hours instead of being on a month-long waiting list  for general treatment or on a few months long waiting list for more specialised  care will drive more customers towards the private health care. We believe the  primary client base for the private healthcare growth in the pool of employed  and self-employed people age between 21-65 years and their family members. From  the data presented above, such pool of customers is about 3,5 million.</p>
            <p class="blog_tekstovi"><b><img src="_images-english/Core market size for private healthcare.png" alt="Market size for private healthcare growth"></b></p>
            <p class="blog_tekstovi"><b>Health  tourism</b>-is another source of future growth, which  is going to come from:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>patients from the neighbouring  countries such as Bosnia, Montenegro, Macedonia, Albania who are used to seek  excellent medical care in Belgrade since 1980&rsquo;s. Belgrade has some excellent  medical facilities which were available to the beneficiaries of the Yugoslav  national health system. Nowadays, in increasing number of patients from the  former Yugoslav republics use private health facilities in Belgrade which they  cannot find in their home countries;</li>
              <li>Serbian diaspora living abroad-  private health facilities in Belgrade offer excellent medical services for a  fraction of the price for the same services in Western Europe or USA. A  significant number of Serbian diaspora living in the EU or USA choose to have  medical treatment in Serbia instead at their country of residence-from dental  treatment to more complicated procedures;</li>
              <li>other clients coming from the  EU, USA and other countries- an increasing number of EU patients are treated in  Serbia because of the high quality care for a fraction of the price in their  home country. This also applies to the medical rehabilitation from illness,  medical treatment or other causes suffered at home, which is usually carried  out in health centres with mineral water rehabilitation (<a href="http://www.seecap.com/_english/privatisation-of-destination-spa-centres-and-health-spa-facilities.html">destination  health spas</a>). </li>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The above analyses leads to some interesting conclusions about the private healthcare system in Serbia:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> income grows from year to year at a rapid pace, much higher than the inflation, as a result of continuing investment in and expansion of the private healthcare, </li>
              <li> the value of the voluntary health insurance is also rapidly growing which will fuel further growth of the private healthcare sector, </li>
              <li>the three largest healthcare providers, Medigroup, Euromedik and Bel Medic recorded a high income growth, in 2017 the combine average was 27,20%, </li>
              <li> Medigroup has made a stunning success in 5 years through merger and acquisition of a large number of compatible businesses and is now sitting on the top as the largest private healthcare provider. The other two groups grew organically since 1990’s, </li>
              <li> the competition is likely to intensify and the leading healthcare will move out of Belgrade to cover some other cities (as Medigroup has already started). The expansion may be through organic growth by setting up own medical practices  or by merging with or acquiring the already existing medical practices. The success of Medigroup shows the latter method, growth thought M&A to be more successful. Such expansion will require financing from outside sources, debt and equity, which, we believe should not be much of a problem because of the increasing interest for such investments and financing. </li>
            </ul>

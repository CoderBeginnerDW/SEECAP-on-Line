        <h2>SALE OF AGRICULTURAL COMPANY <br>
          WITH CONTIGUOUS AGGREGATION OF 435 HECTARES OF FARMLAND</h2>
        <img class="vesti_slike" src="../sr/images/agroland-sale/psenica-1200x450.jpg" title="Our wheat field before harvest" alt="Wheat field before harvest"/>
        <header>
          <p> <img class="slika-neka1" src="../sr/images/agroland-sale/price-hike.jpg" title="Farmland price increase in Serbia" alt="Farmland price increase in Serbia"/> The price of agricultural land in Serbia is <strong>growing by 6-10% per year</strong> (transaction prices published by the Republic Geodetic Authority RGA, the Serbian Land Registry. The demand for it is on the increase by both local and foreign investors. It is regarded as an asset class in its own rights by both, the financial speculative investors and by those who use it as a means of production (agricultural companies). </p>
          <p>One of the main economic and export potentials of Serbia is the production and export of food. Serbia has a mild continental climate, quality land and excellent other conditions for food production and export. In the last ten years, primary and secondary food production has been recovering from the disastrous effects of the Sanctions years and growing continuously. In the last two years, the growth of Serbian agricultural exports has increased by 50%. In 2020, the value of food exports was US$ 4.2 billion.</p>
          <p>After more than 30 years, Serbia has resumed food exports to the UAE, Bahrain, India and China. It is certain that during 2021, this trend will continue and that new markets such as Vietnam and Indonesia will be opened. With the announced investments in transport infrastructure - river, railway and air and multi-modal transhipment capacities for container and bulk cargo, the export of agricultural and food products from Serbia will be not only easier but also cheaper.</p>
          <p>On February 4, 2021, Serbia and China signed several <strong>Protocols on the conditions for the export of corn and dried sugar beet noodles to China</strong>. On that occasion, Vukosav Saković from the Business Association “Serbia Grains” stated:
          </p><blockquote><cite>"This Protocols have removed all administrative obstacles to the appearance of Serbian corn on the Chinese market. That is very important for our country, because the demand for our corn is increasing significantly, which will ultimately have a positive effect on the export prices the local producers will achieve on the international markets."</cite></blockquote>
          <p></p>
          <p>The agricultural land, particularly in Vojvodina is of high quality but much chipper than in other European countries.
            <mark> The price will continue to rise for several fundamental reasons which we explain in detail in our analysis "<a href="agroland-prices.html">Agricultural land in Serbia-prices and trends</a>"</mark>
            . We <strong>highli recomend reading that analysis</strong> to fully comprenend and appriciate this offer. </p>
          <p>We offer an agricultural company/agricultural farm located in Vojvodina, Serbia with contiguous aggregation of 435 hectares of first-class Vojvodina farmland. Such large single piece of farmland (contiguous aggregation) is a rarity and has many advantages over non-contiguous farmland aggregation. The agricultural land is of high quality, there is a system of drainage and irrigation canals as well as an irrigation system, agricultural machinery and equipment and other assets. Part of the farmland is leased to a local farming company and the rest is cultivated by the company. That remaining part can also be leased to the same or another tenant so that the new owner will have two sources of income a) from the lease income and b) from the price increase of agricultural land. Exit from this investment should be relatively easy because agricultural land prices are rising since the farmland is increasingly sought-after asset. </p>

          <h3>Location and infrastructure</h3>
          <img  src="../sr/images/agroland-sale/asfaltni-put.jpg" title="Asphalt road to the comapany and farm" alt="The public road to the company"  class="slika-neka" />
          <p><strong>Location</strong>-Vojvodina, Serbia</p>
          <p><strong>Infrastructure</strong>-to the Company and its agricultural plots leads an excellent asphalt road </p>
          <p>The port operator of the nearby Port of Novi Sad, DP World from Dubai, UAE announced new investments in this port to increase traffic and facilitate the export of grain and other cargo from Serbia to the EU markets or through the port of Constanta, for export to China and other distant buyers. It is planned to build a vertical quay, silo and to reconstruct the existing warehouses. In addition, the construction of a container terminal has been announced. </p>
          <p> There is an electricity transmission line on the property. The company satisfies all its need for electricity from solar collectors so that there are no electricity costs. The property has a well with thermal (hot) water and a well with ordinary water for irrigation. </p>
          <h3>Assets</h3>
          <img  src="../sr/images/agroland-sale/imovina-oranice.jpg" title="Our arable land stretches indefinitely" alt="Our farmland" class="slika-neka" />
          <p><strong>Contiguous aggregation of 435 hectares of agricultural land</strong> ideal for growing field crops, vegetables and fruit. Such composition of farmland significantly facilitates the introduction of modern agro-technical measures - from monitoring and control of crops by drones to the use of "autonomous" machines that already exist - sprayers, seeders, tillage machines, etc. This leads to increased productivity, reduced costs, more efficient resource management, increased food quality but also environmental protection. Digitization of agriculture is inevitable, it is <em>"smart agriculture"</em>“.</p>
          <p>This agricultural season the company has sown 65 ha of wheat and 22 ha of corn. In previous years, the average yield from these field crops was 6t / ha of wheat and 7t / ha of corn.</p>
          <p><strong>The orchard </strong> extends to about 21ha. It is planted with currant, hazelnut and quince fruit trees.</p>
          <p> A part of the land is used <strong>as pastures for grazing and hay production (hayfields))</strong>. The farmhouse and other farm buildings and facilities occupy about 7ha of the land. The rest of the farmland <strong>is leased</strong> to a local farming company. </p>
          <p> <strong>Buildings</strong>-the company has various assets, agricultural machinery and equipment used for farming, livestock keeping and fruit growing. The company is about the process of construction of its own silos for storing field products. The list assets is given in the table below. The hangar with a part of agricultural machinery on the right.</p>

          <p><strong>Other assets and benefits</strong> are set out in the table below. A sheepfold with a flock of sheep is pictured below right. <img src="../sr/images/agroland-sale/other-assets.png" title="Other assets and benefits" alt="Other assets" class="vesti_slike" /> <img src="../sr/images/agroland-sale/ovcara.jpg" title="Sheepfold with flock of sheep" alt="Sheepfold"/> </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Irrigation system</h3>
          <img src="../sr/images/agroland-sale/irrigation.jpg" title="Drainage canals and irrigation" alt="Irrigation system" class="slika-neka" />
          <p>In 2020 the company commenced installation of the "drip" irrigation system for irrigating orchards, which will be completed in May 2021. All installation materials and equipment have been procured, a well with quality water for orchard irrigation has been dug and is ready for use. In addition, there is a network of canals for drainage of excess water in the fields when necessary and / or for their irrigation during dry periods. </p>
          <p>There is a special well 350m deep with thermal (warm) water of 32°C which is planned to be used for prevention of spring frosts in the orchard. Some tests have shown that at a depth of about 500m the water temperature is around 50°C which could be used to heat greenhouses with early vegetable cultivation and other crops.</p>
          <p>The irrigation system and drainage canals are of great importance because the climate is getting drier, the summers are longer with high temperatures. Agricultural land that has the possibility of irrigation will give higher yields and is normally worth more in the future than agricultural land that does not have the conditions for crop irrigation or drainage of excessive amounts of water caused by heavy rainfalls. </p>
          <p>The forecasts are that this unfavourable trend can be expected to continue in the future. This can have far-reaching consequences. In 2012, a drought led to a decline in corn yields, which caused the appearance of aflatoxins in harvested corn. This toxin entered the food chain through animal feed into cow's milk and then on the supermarket shelves in Serbia. </p>
          <p>The agricultural land owned by the company on offer is well equipped to cope with both heavy droughts and excessive rainfall. A well with hot water reduces the possibility of damage to orchards from spring frosts. All these factors reduce the risks of negative atmospheric influences on crops and fruit (drought, frost, heavy rainfall) and increase the value of agricultural land itself.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>The offer </h3>
          <p>Our client is an institutional investor who bought this company several years ago. Large funds have been invested in improving production and expanding capacity. The area of agricultural land has also been significantly increased by purchasing peripheral plots. This additional purchase of plots is an ongoing policy of the company, and the new owner will be able to continue with such a policy, if he so wishes, in accordance with the Law on Agricultural Land (legal pre-emptive right of first refusal when owners of peripheral farmland offer their land for sale). </p>
          <p>In addition to agricultural land, the company has other valuable assets. All agricultural land is registered with the Land Registry without mortgage and other encumbrances. The company has no financial or other liabilities. We offer 100% of the company's share capital on debt free cash free basis (DFCF basis). </p>
          <p>DFCF price is € 5.5 million as on 01.04.2021. There may be an increase in price closer to the harvest of existing field crops because the new owner will have instant benefits from harvesting those field crops.</p>
          <p><strong>We have prepared a detailed sales prospectus with information on business, financial results, assets and other relevant facts.</strong> Various documentation such as evidence of ownership of land plots, buildings and facilities, machinery, financial statements, contracts, etc. will be presented to potential buyers for review and analysis (buyer’s due diligence).</p>
